@defmodule[benchmark]

The goal of the @(racket benchmark) library is to reduce the effort of
writing benchmark harnesses. Specifically, this
library aims to handle the sampling and plot rendering of results using
sound statistical methods. This library is designed for comparing:
different versions of Racket for a fixed set of programs, different versions
of programs with the same version of Racket, or both (different versions
of Racket and different versions of the programs). But as the examples in
the first two sections will show, it is not limited to these use cases.

@section[#:tag "simple example"]{Example: Measuring the Impact of Racket's JIT}

In the following example we evaluate the use of Racket's JIT on two
simple programs, running each with and without JIT, and then plot
the results. The plot renderer groups together the results of running the
same program under different options, distinguishing the different
options using colors.

It's important to note that both examples explicitly call time.
This is because, by default, the time of a benchmark is not the time to
evaluate @(racket (run ...)), but rather the time reported
to stdout by @(racket (run ...)). Had we merely wanted to time how long
it took to evaluate @(racket (run ...)) we would have called
@(racket run-benchmarks) with @(racket #:extract-time 'delta-time).
Such an example will be given in the next section.

@section[#:tag "simple example fibonacci and jit"]{Example: Vectors vs Lists}

Here we use @(racket 'delta-time) to demonstrate measuring the time
to evaluate @(racket (run ...)). At a high level we will be evaluating
lists vs vectors for map and append. Specifically, map and append
(or the appropriate variant) will correspond to our whats, and the
list/vector size and whether we are doing list or vector operations
will corespond to our hows. That is, for each input size, for each
of list and vector, we will evaluate map and append.

          [#:results-file results-file #f])
         (listof benchmark-result?)]{

For each @(racket what), @(racket run) is executed for each
combination of one element from each of the elements of @(racket hows).
Thus, the arity of @(racket run) must be @(racket (+ 1 (length hows))).

@(racket build) and @(racket clean) are functions with the same argument
types as @(racket run) and are run before and after each @(racket num-trials)
runs of @(racket run).

When not @(racket 'delta-time), @(racket extract-time) is
applied to the contents of stdout after each run of @(racket run),
and must produce a @racket[real?] that is the run time of the test.
In this case it is expected that each of the @(racket whats) report
their time via stdout when run.
When @(racket 'delta-time), the time of the benchmark is considered to be the
time it takes to evaluate @(racket (run args ...)).
In this case, each of the @racket[whats] do not need to report their own
time to stdout.

@(racket make-name) takes an element of @(racket whats) and produces a
human-readable representation of the benchmark's name.

@(racket skip) has the same argument types as @(racket run), and when
it evaluates to true the associated benchmark/options combination
is skipped.

If @racket[results-file] is non-false, results will be automatically
persisted to results-file-<n>. Incremental results are recorded after
all runs with a given set of options are finished. For more information
about persisting results, see @secref{Persisting Results}.

Benchmarks are logically specified as an (n+1)-dimensional
matrix where n of the dimensions are options (how to run) and one dimension is
the names/files (what to run). The names/files dimension is specified in the
@(racket whats) list. The options dimensions are specified as
lists in the @(racket hows) list.

In @secref["simple example"], @(racket (list "fib.rkt" "collatz.rkt")) is
the @(racket whats) and @(racket (list (list 'jit 'no-jit))) is the
@(racket hows). That is, there is only one dimension of options for
running @(racket (list 'jit 'no-jit)), and two things to run
@(racket "fib.rkt") and @(racket "collatz.rkt").

So, execution might look something like:
@verbatim{
building (fib.rkt jit)
running (fib.rkt jit) ... (30 times)
cleaning (fib.rkt jit)
building (fib.rkt no-jit)
running (fib.rkt no-jit) ... (30 times)
cleaning (fib.rkt no-jit)
building (collatz.rkt jit)
running (collatz.rkt jit) ... (30 times)
cleaning (collatz.rkt jit)
building (collatz.rkt no-jit)
running (collatz.rkt no-jit) ... (30 times)
cleaning (collatz.rkt no-jit)
}

}

@subsection[#:tag "extracting time"]{Extracting Reported Time}

@defproc[(racket-time-extract-result [str string?])
         real?]{
To be used with @(racket #:extract-time) for the output of
Racket's @(racket time). Note: this is the default for the
@(racket #:extract-time) argument of @(racket run-benchmarks).
}

@subsection{Progress Logging}

To track progress of a benchmarking run, @racket[run-benchmarks] logs actions
(building, running, cleaning) it takes on a logged named @racket['benchmark] at
logging level @racket['info].

The easiest way to see this logging is to run your benchmark harness with:
@commandline|{racket -W info@benchmark harness.rkt}|

@secref[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{logging}.

of benchmarks using the @(racket plot) library.

         renderer2d?]{
Produces a @(racket renderer2d?) of normalized time
for the specified benchmark results with error bars
based on 95% confidence intervals. The time of a benchmark is
normalized against the benchmark with the same name but
@(racket norm-opts) for options.

@(racket norm-opts) is the list of options
(from @(racket hows)) of @(racket run) that are the standard
options.

For example, @(racket (list 'jit)) is the list of standard
options in @secref["simple example"].

@(racket benchmark-results) are the results produced by
@(racket run-benchmarks).

@(racket format-opts) formats the list of options into strings
for displaying on the legend of the plot.

If @racket[normalize?] is @racket[#f], then the results will not be normalized.
}

@defparam[benchmark-show-legend? show-legend? any/c #:value #t]{
Determines whether the generated plot should include a legend.
}

@subsection[#:tag "Color Schemes"]{Color Schemes}
Color schemes are used to make benchmark plots more readable by
coloring benchmarks according to the options (hows). In @secref["simple example"]
the 'jit' option is salmon and the 'no-jit' option blue.

@defparam[current-benchmark-color-scheme benchmark-color-scheme (cons/c (listof plot-color/c) (listof plot-brush-style/c))]{
Default is @(racket pastel-color-scheme). Parameter controlling
color scheme used by @(racket render-benchmark-alts).

Available color schemes:
@deftogether[(@defthing[bright-color-scheme (cons/c (listof plot-color/c) (listof plot-brush-style/c))]
@defthing[pastel-color-scheme (cons/c (listof plot-color/c) (listof plot-brush-style/c))]
@defthing[black-white-color-scheme-short (cons/c (listof plot-color/c) (listof plot-brush-style/c))]
@defthing[black-white-color-scheme-medium-1 (cons/c (listof plot-color/c) (listof plot-brush-style/c))]
@defthing[black-white-color-scheme-medium-2 (cons/c (listof plot-color/c) (listof plot-brush-style/c))]
@defthing[black-white-color-scheme-long (cons/c (listof plot-color/c) (listof plot-brush-style/c))])]{
A few color schemes provided for convenience. Length (short, medium, and long)
corresponds to the number of distinct colors that are used. 'short' is 3,
'medium' is 5, and 'long' is 8. In the event that there are more
unique combinations of options, the colors wrap around.
}

@section[#:tag "Persisting Results"]{Persisting Results}
Results can be persisted with @(racket record-results) and retrieved
with @(racket get-past-results). Results can also be automatically
persisted by @racket[run-benchmarks] when passed a @racket[#:results-file]
argument.

@defproc[(record-results [results (listof benchmark-result?)]
                         [file path?])
